# karma_hud
This is a standalone hud, incorporating a compass (north, south, east, west, southwest, southeast, northeast, northwest) 
and a clock to find out what time it is in-game.
At first I wanted to make the real time but I think it would give several problems when using it in different places in the world.

You can traslate the code in the client side.

### This script is fully editable and I plan to improve it in the future.

This script may experience several failures, if so I would appreciate it if you would let me know
